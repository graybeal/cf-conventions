# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about the CF Conventions

This page covers many of the most common questions asked about the Climate and Forecast conventions (and Standard Names). If you have a question that isn't on this list, please ask it of the CF-metadata mail list, so that the CF community can respond. We will use that list as the basis for additional content for this set of questions.

The questions are organized by topic. Click on any question to go to its answer.

## Working with the CF Convention

<a name="standalone"></a>
### Do the CF conventions stand alone?
Not entirely; because CF is a netCDF convention, it assumes the netCDF standard is being followed. It also is based on the netCDF convention called the [COARDS conventions](http://ferret.wrc.noaa.gov/noaa_coop/coop_cdf_profile.html) (for their sponsor, the Cooperative Ocean/Atmosphere Research Data Service), developed in 1995.  And it relies on the UDUNITS system of specifying units (see <a href="#udunits">CF and COARDS units</a> below). 

CF does not replicate the information from these other standards and conventions, so to adhere to CF you have to become familiar with the other specifications as well.

CF does try to be self-contained, for example the CF Standard Names attempt to be as general and well-defined as possible, so the reader does not have to access outside sources to understand the terms.
