# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about the CF Conventions

This page covers many of the most common questions asked about the Climate and Forecast conventions (and Standard Names). If you have a question that isn't on this list, please ask it of the CF-metadata mail list, so that the CF community can respond. We will use that list as the basis for additional content for this set of questions.

The questions are organized by topic.

## CF Background

* What is COARDS?

## CF Standard Names

* How do I get a standard name added to the CF Standard Names?

## COARDS Units 

These are not strictly the domain of CF, but as CF is standardized on them, often they become the subject of CF questions.
